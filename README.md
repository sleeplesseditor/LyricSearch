# LyricSearch

A lyric search app built using React, the Context API, and the musicMatch API, as per Brad Traversy's [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDEt0KdDbhk&list=PLillGF-RfqbaxgxkKgKk1XlJAVCX31xRI).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
