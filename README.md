# LyricSearch

A lyric search app built using React, the Context API, and the musixMatch API, as per Brad Traversy's [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NDEt0KdDbhk&list=PLillGF-RfqbaxgxkKgKk1XlJAVCX31xRI). This app has been tested with the free version of the API, but could be upgraded to have additional features with the [paid tier of the API](https://developer.musixmatch.com/).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
